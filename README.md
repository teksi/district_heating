A pilot project as proof of concept was done in 2024 to test, how a new module Distric Heating should look like and to check, whether the architecur principales developed for TEKSI wastewater could be easily applied to another module.

## Welcome to the TEKSI district Module GitHub Home page ðŸ‘‹
TEKSI district heating module (project name: TDH) is a selection of tools and a database implementation that allows you to:

* manage and map your district heating network data with all its components in compliance with Swiss standards
* indicate the characteristics of networks objects in the form of attributes such as diameter, material, depth, damages, construction year, etc.
* produce plans and extract statistics from the database such as network values, total length of pipes, identification of future interventions, etc.
* Use TEKSI to do your planning for your community or your association needs.

TEKSI district heating module is a complete open source module based on a PostgreSQL - PostGIS data model compatible with the swiss norm SIA405 AND VSA-DSS. The data are accessed and edited with a dedicated QGIS project.
The project is maintained by the [TEKSI community](https://www.teksi.ch)

[TEKSI](https://www.teksi.ch) is a non profit Swiss association set up to support open source professional GIS projects aiming to ease the management of public infrastructures.
