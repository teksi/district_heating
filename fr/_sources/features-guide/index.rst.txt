TEKSI district heating (TDH)
============================================

TEKSI district heating is a selection of tools and a database implementation that allows you to:

* manage and map your district heating network data with all its components in compliance with Swiss standards
* indicate the characteristics of networks objects in the form of attributes such as diameter, material, depth, damages, construction year, etc.
* produce plans and extract statistics from the database such as network values, total length of pipes, identification of future interventions, etc.
* export geodata in compliance with Swiss standards

Main features
-------------

**Network objects**

Creation, information and management of network elements according to the swiss SIA 405 model:

* District heating installations
* Network elements
* Pipes
* Trenches

TOOO : INSERT HERE THE chosen parts of the actual datamodel (POC related perimeter)
